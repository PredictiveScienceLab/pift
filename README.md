# Physics-informed Information Field Theory

## TODO for Alex

+ Read the file `examples/example_01.py` and modify it to make the plots you
need for Example 1.
+ Read the file `examples/example_01.sh`. You can use this file to produce all
the figures for Example 1.
You can run it from your terminal by typing: `./examples/example_01.sh` from the
pift directory.
+ Read the file `examples/example_02.py`. This is reproducing Example 2. But
with the same problem as Example 1.
I think this is better. You could add another example with the integrated
squared residual if you want.

## Examples

+ Example 1 - Demonstrate the effect of beta on the forward problem.
+ Example 2 - Demonstrate how beta can be picked when adding data.
We will use a bisection algorithm to find the best beta. Vary:
  - number of observations
  - observation noise

Alex is working on problem 1.
